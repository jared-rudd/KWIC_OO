# KWIC System â€“ Object-Oriented Implementation (Group 2)

This project contains the Object-Oriented implementation of the KWIC system, developed by Group 2 for Assignment 2.1 for CSI 5352.

The implementation follows a modular design using classes to handle input processing, circular shifting, alphabetization, and output. Each component is encapsulated for clarity, reusability, and maintainability.
